This is my 3rd web page clone, and I wanted to keep the focus on building my HTML and CSS skill. There are still some issues with positioning, and I believe that I "overcomplicated" the layout/order of my HTML. 
In due time, I will continue to improve the structure of my code and styling. I also started to utilize Git within my IDE in order to create a streamlined workspace, as I want to be able to work on projects from different locatations, and update future projects I build.

After the next couple basic html/css web clones I will create a basic Web Portfolio with the concepts and strategies I learned from HTML/CSS, then begin learning about JavaScript, Front-End Libraries to create more intuitive, responsive and modern web pages.
I will also begin publishing "bigger" repositorys and projects in terms of User Accessibility and Navigation.
